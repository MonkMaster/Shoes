Plain and simple<br>

We are here to get you deals on shoes. Shoemonk finds the best sales on brand name shoes on the web and puts them in one place.<br><br>

<b>Why are we different?</b><br>

Shoemonk donates one dollar from each pair of shoes that we profit on to charity (more charity details below). That means that for each pair that shoemonk sees a dime, <b>we donate up to 53% of our profits.</b><br><br>

One more time for emphasis! - <b>We donate up to 53% of our profits</b>. That means you get cheap shoes, we keep the business running, and our charity recieves donations. That's three wins! :)<br><br>

We use affiliate marketing to support our website, which means we get paid commission on
some of the products we display on our site. We are not influenced by advertisers or affiliate
marketing programs.<br><br>

<b>Our Charity</b><br>

$1 from every revenue generating sale will be donated to the Pingalwara foundation in Northern India, which provides shelter, food, and education for poor and abandoned children. <br><br>

Why did we choose this charity you ask? First hand experience. Our shoemonk admin has visited some Pingalwara Foundations sites in India and has seen the great things that they do for children. We also decided to choose a charity overseas because through our travels we have learnt that money definitely goes much farther in these areas. $1 for children in India can give much more benefit than it can here in North America. Our admin also has ties that live in the region year round and can therefore see and track how the money is being used. <br><br>

We will soon have a seperate webpage dedicated to this charity's information and how you can donate without having to buy shoes.<br><br><br>



**Disclaimer: Nike, Jordan, Converse, and Supra have a customs charge that is added to the product because these products are shipped from the US. The customs charge can be 25% or 34% of the products price depending in which province you reside in. You can check the "Additional Sales!!" button for savings to offset the customs charge. Eastbay.com is a FootLocker inc. company.
